As a research engineer at the United Technologies Research Center, my role is to develop and deliver data analytics solutions for UTC's business units on prognostics and condition-based maintenance, machine-learning based computer vision for augmented/virtual reality integration in human-machine interaction systems, and evaluating potential innovative technologies to satisfy needs of UTC's customers. Prior to joining UTRC in January 2017, I have two years of graduate research experience in actively leading, managing, and serving as the consultant for 7 different cross-disciplinary projects with strong emphasis on machine learning techniques (especially Deep Learning), notably for engineering-centric applications on (1) inertial flow sculpting, (2) early detection of combustion instabilities in jet engines, (3) collaborative human-machine interaction systems, (4) vision enhancement for autonomous systems, (5) optimization of undersea wireless surveillance sensor networks, (6) root-cause analysis & anomaly detection in cyber-physical systems, and (7) plant phenotyping and disease prediction.

# Employment and Experiences

### Senior Research Engineer / Data Scientist (2017 - Present)  
**United Technologies Research Center, East Hartford CT**  
In United Technologies Research Center (UTRC), a division of United Technologies Corporation, I worked on multiple projects for business units ranging from developing data-driven machine learning models for condition-based maintenance of OTIS elevators, data analytics for Pratt & Whitney's rig and revenue service engines, and deep-learning powered part inspection algorithms. From an R&D perspective, I have designed deep learning architectures for virtual sensing, computer vision applications, as well as U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)-funded projects to detect faults and cyber-attacks on networked power grids.

Since early 2017, I am a key member in the team responsible for driving OTIS ONE where the goal of the product is to deliver transparent information, proactive communications, and predictive insights for elevator fleets. My primary role is to analyze data and develop interpretable machine learning models to assist Remote Elevator Monitoring (REM) experts and orchestrate cloud-based solutions for condition-based maintenance, predictive maintenance, and targeted maintenance.

### Graduate Research Assistant (2015 - 2017)
**Self-aware Complex Systems, Iowa State University, Ames IA**  
As a research assistant I have worked on multiple projects simultaneously with strong emphasis on machine learning based approach. Projects include:
1. Microfluidic device design for inertial flow sculpting using Deep Learning approaches;
1. Early detection of combustion instability in jet engines using a neural-symbolic approach;
1. Value-of-information estimation in collaborative human-machine interaction systems;
1. Low-light vision enhancement for autonomous systems;
1. Optimization of undersea wireless surveillance sensor networks;
1. Root-cause analysis & anomaly detection in cyber-physical systems;
1. Plant phenotyping using Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) classification techniques; and
1. Determination of component manufacturability via predictive analytics.
